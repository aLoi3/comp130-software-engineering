## How artificially intelligent agents can be improved in flexibility in a test-driven development?

## What programming paradigms are more suitable for artificially intelligent agents?

Throughout the last few centuries "computer" has become one of the most important technologies we have now.
Therefore, the field of engineering has become very powerful today.
Software engineering refers to the disciplined and scientific approach to developing advanced software.
The field has made a wide range of software that supports different systems and applications.
Such are artificially intelligent agents, which are going to be discussed in this paper.
Moreover, in this paper will be discussed what programming paradigms are better for this area.

There are a few intelligent agents, some are simple and the other are more complex.
And each following is an improved version of the previous one.
An improved versions are more adaptable and flexible agents.
